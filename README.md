# Narrative-Visualization-Exploration-of-Unsplash-dataset
ABSTRACT Peopleâ€™s preference for images might be reflected by the image information they attached along with the image they shot or downloaded. Understanding the relationships between these tags and images can help to understand how people view the  world and how people from various places view the same ob- ject differently. Unsplash dataset is utilized in this study to  explore this relationship and visualize the prediction model based on the information provided by users. Generally, people  enjoy photos with colors of black or gray style and with key- words of natural scenery all across the world. Canon, Nikon,  and Sony are the top three camera brands people choose for photographing. A prediction model is developed based on this  information and a photo recommendation is provided. Low- dimensional visualization is also provided in this study for a  fuzzy explanation of how different labels of images related  to each other. This study could deploy the model to a user- friendly interface on data visualization and provide a generic  method to explore large image datasets.
